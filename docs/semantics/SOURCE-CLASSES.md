# Named empty classes and object identity

The source compiler records named empty class declarations with their checked
origin, resolved name, flags and line. Early declarations become active before
the first statement; conditional and function-local declarations publish only
when execution reaches them. A normalized active-name table keeps declaration
timing separate from compiled source. Redeclaration reports the original name
and location; occupied internal class, interface and enum names follow the
pinned CLI `-n` catalogue of 166 names. Enum kinds use
`ReflectionClass::isEnum()`. The catalogue supplies names and diagnostic kinds,
not internal bodies.

`new` resolves a named, concrete user class before allocating an object in the
existing owned heap. The current admitted form has no constructor arguments or
members. Copies preserve object identity; two distinct empty instances of the
same class compare loosely equal, while strict comparison uses identity.
Literal `instanceof` tests the active source class or an existing `Closure`
object; missing class names and scalar left operands return false. Undefined
variables still issue their usual warning. Class-typed parameters and returns
accept the exact nominal source class, with case-insensitive spelling.
An empty instance is noncallable in direct, first-class and pipe calls and in
`callable` type checks. Its array cast is empty; Closure keeps its separate
array-cast behavior. Object key, offset and conversion errors use the source
class name.

Source origins authenticate descriptors, active bindings, class/new/instanceof
tasks and paused `instanceof` results. Owned objects remain live through arrays
and are released after their final owner. The pinned engine routes are `zend_compile_class_decl`,
`zend_compile_new` and `zend_compile_instanceof` in
`vendor/php-src/Zend/zend_compile.c`, and the `ZEND_NEW` and `ZEND_INSTANCEOF`
handlers in `Zend/zend_vm_def.h`.

The rules are in `126-class-compiler.watsup` and `127-class-runtime.watsup`.
[The review](../../coverage/semantics/object-classes-review.json) records the
source and paused-state checks. Other internal-class construction, constructor
arguments, inheritance, properties, methods, dynamic class names, late-bound
`self`/`parent`/`static`, array and class-method callback invocation, and
lifecycle protocols remain separate obligations.
