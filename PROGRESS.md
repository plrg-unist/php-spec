# Core PHP semantics progress

Target: PHP 8.5.10 CLI NTS 64-bit. [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) defines complete core;
[the inventory](coverage/semantics/features.json) tracks obligations. Selected
agreement does not establish complete semantics. Large evidence stays outside
Git; [ARTIFACTS.md](docs/ARTIFACTS.md) locates it.

## Current checkpoint

Source-certified warning-truth decisions209 preserve the original null across
handler mutation and suppress pending consumers on throw. Private ordinary
8normal/225 and independent native-reused model3/160 remain separate from current
PIPE normal/throw1/69+1/corrected96 and deferred-cache normal/throw1/95+1/89.
The current211 composition at `38cab574` accepts author source1/93 and independent
strict instance-emitter source1/107, preserving original-null choices and throw cleanup.
The [truth ledger](coverage/semantics/warning-truth-review.json) records each tested
revision/profile and original failures; source-equivalent publication adds no
execution or rebuild credit.

Public method-array and class-method-string error handlers register raw values and
select afresh at dispatch. Entered targets retain genuine emitter scope, arguments
and owners through member mutation, nested replacement, throw and false fallback.
The [method-handler ledger](coverage/semantics/handler-callables-current-review.json)
keeps mixed author/independent checks, current CONFIG PIPE and original failures
at their actual revisions.

The installed families compose as follows; each ledger records its scope and limits.

| Family | Current behavior and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Class constants183/184 | Owner-scoped lazy scalar/array caches preserve strict typing, inheritance priority and compile-entry availability. Warning-read and completed static-getter interactions retain cache roots/aliases;50 source observations keep their separate revisions. Closure/FCC initializers and broader consumers remain open. [Constants ledger](coverage/semantics/class-constants-current-review.json). |
| Warning-truth decisions209 | Branch/loop/short-circuit/NOT/ternary-condition choices consume the captured null even after handlers define the CV. Saved consumers and thrown-handler cleanup retain authenticated source/line. Casts/copy/SEND remain open. [Truth ledger](coverage/semantics/warning-truth-review.json). |
| Borrowed warning reads208 | Strict identity retains the old reference cell across callbacks without adding an owner; saved callers and throw cleanup preserve it. Defined ordinary `$GLOBALS[key]` uses the real table. Getter/setter and method-string interactions keep separate revisions. [Warning-read ledger](coverage/semantics/warning-reads-review.json). |
| Error handlers/reporting206/207/211 | Named, closure, public source-object, ordinary method-array and class-method-string callbacks retain raw registration values and select afresh at dispatch. Entered targets, four arguments and genuine emitting frames survive member mutation, replacement, nested reentry, throw and false fallback; current CONFIG PIPE preserves weak receive and original-null trace. Broader scope/magic/internal/exception/lifecycle forms and reporting readback remain open. [Method-handler ledger](coverage/semantics/handler-callables-current-review.json), [earlier handler ledger](coverage/semantics/error-handlers-review.json). |
| Class-method strings210 and FCC119 | Full-byte lookup separates frame-based callable admission, computed static dispatch and fixed compatible-this selection. Captures/clone retain immutable source certificates and defaults/static cells. A named throwing handler preserves the selected static caller and arguments. [String ledger](coverage/semantics/class-method-strings-current-review.json). |
| Method arrays205 | Public source method arrays retain immutable selected receiver/owner/called-class certificates through dynamic calls and capture. Current two-slot INI checkpoint **f9f47f115/61370c98/1353** accepts source1/finite103; broader resolution remains open. [Array ledger](coverage/semantics/array-callables-current-review.json). |
| Include/configuration | Stringable CHDIR PIPE captures post-callback CWD and retains held operands; unary CONFIG PIPE also preserves source strictness and callback guards through borrowed warnings. [PIPE ledger](coverage/semantics/include-config-pipe-review.json). Raw getters, primitive/null Restore, weak-null handler continuations and two-slot INI ownership retain their separate checkpoints. [Readback](coverage/semantics/include-ini-readback-review.json), [INI](coverage/semantics/include-stringable-ini-option-review.json). |
| Stringable SET/Restore and paths | SET separates raw INI bytes from effective C-string paths. Weak Restore uses exact full-name lookup and preserves callback mutations on misses. Current ARG/Restore checks retain caller arguments and zero-argument callbacks. [Restore](coverage/semantics/include-stringable-restore-review.json), [prefix](coverage/semantics/include-ini-prefix-review.json), [SET](coverage/semantics/include-set-current-review.json). |
| Typed static properties197 | Weak simple Stringable assignment rechecks live aliases and retains paired callback owners. Current Restore/ARG/INI composition preserves full property bytes, caller arguments and normal/throw cleanup. [Property ledger](coverage/semantics/typed-static-string-assignment-review.json). |
| Static setters200/201 | Backed final/asymmetric declarations normalize equivalent setters and preserve inheritance/error priority; direct and indirect consumers retain lexical access, live raw-slot checks and typed aliases. [Setter ledger](coverage/semantics/static-setter-access-review.json). |
| StaticCall reference acquisition141/142 | Selected getters with untyped return signatures retain scoped selection, typed static aliases and returned-cell cleanup. Typed REF flags preserve initialization/error priority and alias creation even when discarded; post-return ownership/type-source checks and completed constant tables retain the typed alias; getter/borrowed-read reentry keeps its frame. [Reference ledger](coverage/semantics/static-method-reference-review.json). |
| Argument introspection198/199 | Ordinary current and saved frames retain genuine named/unpacked argument views through invocation and callbacks. [Argument ledger](coverage/semantics/argument-introspection-calls-current-review.json). |
| Public invocation and callable typing | Public source `__invoke` is installed at **18a1383d7**; callable-before-string parameter admission at **b8a6f43f8** preserves dual-role objects across weak/strict, union order, inheritance and ownership. [Invocation](coverage/semantics/source-invoke-current-review.json), [parameter reception](coverage/semantics/callable-string-current-review.json). |
| Selection and capture | Source method selection preserves owner/called class; capture/clone retains selected targets and scoped defaults/static cells without retaining retired origin-only creators. [Capture](coverage/semantics/method-capture-current-review.json), [default caches](coverage/semantics/closure-default-cache-review.json). |
| Compiler publication190–196 | Ordered class/function availability, early diagnostics and authenticated declaration history compose with calls and callbacks. Compile-stop freezes saved callers and retires active file replies; it does not perform ordinary unwind. [Publication ledger](coverage/semantics/compiler-publication-review.json). |

Executables and compiler inputs are reused; source-equivalent publication adds
no rebuild or fresh execution credit. Earlier selector, capture, invocation and
baseline milestones remain in [MILESTONE-HISTORY.md](MILESTONE-HISTORY.md) and the
linked ledgers. [Cleanup](coverage/semantics/error-origin-author.json) and
[migration](coverage/semantics/throwable-migration-review.json) retain deferred
failures and interrupted evidence.

## Remaining core work

- Calls: broader class/method-string consumers, nonpublic/static `__invoke` publication,
  compound/scope-dependent array resolution, magic/autoload/internal consumers,
  transformed wrappers and broader CONFIG PIPE consumers. Only the selected captured-static
  array and string Closure PIPE routes are covered; defined ordinary `$GLOBALS[key]` is admitted; missing-global warnings and whole-table snapshots remain partial.
- Include/configuration: broader warning producers, wider directives
  and reporting readback, OS services and lifecycle. The
  [include contract](docs/semantics/INCLUDE-SOURCES.md) separates these consumers.
- Values, references and coercion: broader weak parameter/property conversion,
  constrained-reference object conversion, wider nonstatic delayed receivers and
  broader reference-result consumers. Deferred property defaults and references into incomplete constant tables remain Unsupported.
  Untyped static-slot raw-object/scalar reference-return admission remains open.
  Named error constants such as E_USER_NOTICE remain unsupported by initial lookup;
  the handled-notice check uses literal1024. Generic156 return replay, temporary-return
  Notice timing and typed
  by-reference string conversion186 remain open; accepted ordinary by-value
  classification does not close them. [String contract](docs/semantics/USER-STRING.md),
  [finally contract](docs/semantics/SOURCE-FINALLY.md).
- Objects and lifetime: remaining static members, traits, hooks, readonly/instance asymmetric
  access, traversal, output handlers and lifecycle callbacks. Static cells remain
  partial across trait/inheritance sharing, bind/clone, include/eval reactivation
  and GC. [Method](docs/semantics/SOURCE-METHODS.md),
  [static-property](docs/semantics/SOURCE-CLASS-STATICS.md) contracts.
- Control and diagnostics: Generator/Fiber, remaining warning/read producers,
  exception/lifecycle handlers and broader API/callable argument consumers.
  Broader constant consumers and compiler reporting interactions remain open.
  get_called_class() remains an unimplemented introspection body; static::class
  observations do not close it.

`returns_verify` is temporarily paused by the user. Preserve its branches and
evidence; do not retry the blocked engine experiment, substitute a reviewer,
merge changes awaiting its validation, or begin work depending on those
unaccepted changes. Independent work proceeds from the accepted baseline.

Rocq interaction-tree semantics and BOLA proofs follow completed PHP core.

## Validated baseline

The post-arrow checkpoint is **1026/0ec57507**, with arrow capture and returns
117/118 at **87cdc532f**. Its [review](coverage/semantics/post-arrow-integration-review.json)
binds these distinct profiles and independent audits:

| Gate | Accepted observations |
| --- | --- |
| Compiler | 5,751 source lints, 8 access sources, 15 line observations; existing binary reused |
| Explicit request | 263 source profiles, 526 responses with exact request/environment facts |
| Callable | 946 maintained rows in 18 suites plus one regression; 1,894 responses |
| Ordinary | 5,706 source comparisons (4,060 normal, 1,006 PHP errors, 640 static rejections), 21 separate controls; 11,435 process records |

These are observations, not unique PHP programs or current full-core coverage.
Ordinary, request and callable profiles have different environment contracts;
their counts are not interchangeable.

## Validation and integration limits

The authorized cap is five numerical/model campaigns with coordinated slot
handoffs. Record the tested revision, compiler/runtime identity, relevant inputs,
environment, exact commands/exits and raw originals. Independent review focuses
on semantic counterexamples and reliable completion; investigate failures
narrowly and repeat only affected checks. Metadata adds no execution credit.

Interrupted runs, timeouts, Unsupported and budget controls are never native
agreements. Paused-state fixtures complement original-source comparisons; passing
subsets do not establish equivalence or full core. Final combined current-source
gates and a fresh copied-path, network-isolated offline rebuild remain required.
