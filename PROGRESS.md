# Core PHP semantics progress

Target: **PHP 8.5.10 CLI, NTS, signed 64-bit integers**. [PLAN](PLAN.md) defines
complete core; the [inventory](coverage/semantics/features.json) tracks the 169
syntax constructors and 306 runtime obligations. The executable core remains
partial. Syntax acceptance and selected agreement do not establish full semantics
or BOLA freedom. [CORE](docs/semantics/CORE.md) defines the intrinsic boundary.

## Current checkpoint

OP84 is composed over `52af2e140`/410. NaN LEFT short-circuit decisions now read the live ordinary float CV after
its named Warning callback. Writing `0.0` skips `&&`/`and` RIGHT and enters
`||`/`or` RIGHT; later RHS writes do not retake LEFT. A truthy write plus supplied
Exception prevents RHS execution and the outer store. The nonowning marker
restores the authenticated decision task with a Boolean result.

Five source agreements/full410 and 511 premises (178/198/135) retain
`9a14e5244`/410. Keyword forms have source agreements; focused states cover
symbolic skip, enter and throw, including derived truth/no-rewarning/refusals.
Native preparation, genuine pre-H Unsupported and static checks keep zero credit.
[Short-circuit review](coverage/semantics/short-circuit-nan-warning-review.json).
RIGHT NaN, references/other conditional consumers and wider handlers remain partial.
Publication and actual-tail review are independently complete; paused boundaries remain unchanged.

## Integrated behavior and entrypoints

Each family is bounded; its linked contract and inventory entries retain the
implemented cases, exclusions, exact tested revisions and independent reviews.

| Family | Current behavior and scope pointers |
| --- | --- |
| Source and compilation | Checked ASTs retain source occurrences, ordered publication, compilation phases and diagnostic priority. Dynamic source and request inputs have explicit provider boundaries. [Compiler](docs/semantics/SOURCE-COMPILER.md), [context](docs/semantics/SOURCE-CONTEXT.md), [dynamic source](docs/semantics/DYNAMIC-SOURCE.md). |
| Operators and warning decisions | Arithmetic/casts distinguish saved values from live CVs and stage supported diagnostics through callbacks. Direct NaN Boolean NOT/Boolean cast produce stricttrue/false after a live0.0 write; NaN array casting constructs a fresh singleton from that live float. Initially-NaN LEFT logical XOR caches post-warning truth across live RIGHT conversion, including remaining default Warning before a LEFT throw unwinds. Retained-reference Boolean NOT keeps its captured inner cell across source unset/rebinding. NaN LEFT short-circuit decisions use post-callback truth to skip or enter RIGHT. Copied fractional BITNOT retains its saved integer. [Operators](docs/semantics/ORDINARY-OPERATORS.md), [truth callbacks](docs/semantics/SOURCE-WARNING-TRUTH.md), [numerics](docs/semantics/NUMERICS.md). |
| Comparisons and arrays | Seven missing-CV comparisons admit bounded DIRECT/ALIAS arrays, including ordinary non-Stringable object leaves. Recursive acyclic DIRECT array-edge graphs preserve shared deep COW snapshots and final child release; ALIAS-held child arrays stay flat. [DIRECT graph review](coverage/semantics/undefined-comparison-direct-array-graph-review.json), [child-array review](coverage/semantics/undefined-comparison-array-payload-review.json). Undefined key variables in array literals resume Warning callbacks with a fixed empty key and live null/bool/int/float CVs; initially owning ordinary ARRAY CVs also preserve acquisition and retarget retention/debt through throw and balanced inverse writes. [Primitive review](coverage/semantics/array-literal-undefined-key-warning-review.json), [ARRAY-CV review](coverage/semantics/array-literal-undefined-key-array-cv-review.json). NULL-key literals support bounded CV, returned, temporary and pooled CONST values. Nested DIRECT TMP graphs preserve shared physical child edges and handler-time COW, cascading unowned runtime descendants while folded siblings remain pooled. [Nested TMP review](coverage/semantics/array-literal-null-key-array-tmp-subtree-review.json), [nested CONST review](coverage/semantics/array-literal-null-key-constant-subtree-review.json). [Comparisons](docs/semantics/COMPARISONS.md), [dimensions](docs/semantics/DIMENSIONS.md), [object-reference review](coverage/semantics/undefined-comparison-object-reference-array-review.json). |
| Calls and configuration | Ordinary/scoped/captured calls preserve selected targets, argument order, references and genuine callback frames. Two singleton INI_SET packs retain raw NULL/quiet ARRAY, callee and option through later effects. Initialized user Iterators stream integer-key/string sends into INI_SET with callback ordering, pre-API retirement and supplied-Exception recovery. Bounded WeakMaps now distinguish empty arity failure from occupied object-key Error before any current copy. [Calls](docs/semantics/SOURCE-CALLS.md), [include/configuration](docs/semantics/INCLUDE-SOURCES.md), [two-pack review](coverage/semantics/ini-set-two-pack-null-array-value-review.json), [Iterator CONFIG review](coverage/semantics/config-iterator-unpack-review.json), [WeakMap CONFIG review](coverage/semantics/config-weakmap-unpack-review.json). |
| Constants and callable values | Bounded DEFINE/CONSTANT/DEFINED preserve source authority, scopes, primitive/array/object snapshots and captured intrinsic Closure identity. Captured Boolean/integer/finite-float/NULL queries preserve strict ordinary versus weak explicit reception, raw/received trace arguments and callee ownership through deprecation callbacks. Captured positional Stringable queries distinguish ordinary prelookup destruction from explicit raw-wrapper retention and strict raw-object rejection. [Constant contract](docs/semantics/SOURCE-USER-CONSTANTS.md), [scalar-query review](coverage/semantics/constant-owned-scalar-query-review.json), [NULL-query review](coverage/semantics/constant-owned-null-query-review.json), [Stringable-query review](coverage/semantics/constant-owned-stringable-query-review.json). |
| Classes and properties | Visibility, references, typed writes, hooks, magic access and clone have bounded routes. Same-name implicit getter recursion delivers captured NULL for missing/untyped UNSET, declaring-class Error for public typed UNSET, and receiver-class visibility Error for actual private/protected denial; real guards survive local cleanup. [Properties](docs/semantics/SOURCE-PROPERTIES.md), [classes](docs/semantics/SOURCE-CLASSES.md), [recursion review](coverage/semantics/magic-get-recursion-review.json), [declared-UNSET review](coverage/semantics/magic-get-unset-recursion-review.json), [typed reentry review](coverage/semantics/magic-get-recursive-error-review.json), [denied reentry review](coverage/semantics/magic-get-denied-recursion-review.json). |
| Generators and Fibers | Direct named bodies entered by CURRENT/NEXT preserve their authentic resumer across Fiber suspension and supplied-Throwable injection, with distinct fresh/cached reentry Errors. [Transfer review](coverage/semantics/generator-fiber-transfer-review.json). Shared delegation, initialization history, unused snapshots and abrupt SEND cleanup retain their bounded contracts. [Generators](docs/semantics/GENERATORS.md), [Fibers](docs/semantics/FIBERS.md), [delegation](docs/semantics/GENERATOR-DELEGATION.md), [refresh review](coverage/semantics/generator-refresh-unused-current-review.json). |
| Returns and lifetime | Bounded by-reference return/finally chains retain remaining owners, local catches and consumed recovery through normal/throw retirement. First C retirement with one REF/object remainder preserves local catch, the computed-return Notice and a detached caller cell. Singleton WeakMap collection follows canonical reference-cell backedges and array entries containing Key references, discovering conditional values from white keys without adding physical owners. Bounded foreach drops Map DATA at loop exit while copied object Key/Value CVs survive. By-reference traversal shares the entry cell, preserving rebinding, raw-NULL presence and residual alias disposal through Key notification. [WeakMap review](coverage/semantics/weak-map-review.json). The finite `returns_verify` work is complete; wider PHP return and lifetime coverage remains open. [Return contract](docs/semantics/SOURCE-REFERENCE-RETURNS.md), [eager cleanup](docs/semantics/SOURCE-EAGER-DESTRUCTORS.md), [return review](coverage/semantics/reference-return-local-cv-lifetime-review.json). |
| Diagnostics and environment | Supported warning/exception handlers retain raw registration, selected callback and emitting frame. Request facts, inclusion and lifecycle effects stay explicit. [Handlers](docs/semantics/SOURCE-ERROR-HANDLERS.md), [exception handlers](docs/semantics/SOURCE-EXCEPTION-HANDLERS.md), [request inputs](docs/semantics/REQUEST-INPUTS.md). |

## Active and unintegrated work

| Track | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| V103 Stringable argument destructor | Source3 passed; focused helpers under review. |
| Source89 IteratorAggregate CONFIG | Source3/strict411/fixed144 accepted; original owned154 timeout retained, remaining-only partitions running. |
| COMP121 ALIAS recursive DIRECT DAG | Source10/two controls retained; focused partition after allocation failure (zero credit). |
| M138 WeakMap follow-up | Native2 retained; genuine stale entry/storage refusal and Value-retention mismatch, rule review. |

Iterator49/50/51/52/53, V99/V100/V101/V102, M132/M133/M134/M135/M136/M137, A46/A47/A48/A49/A50, OP79/80/81/82/83/84, Source86/87/88, COMP118/119/120 and CLASS119/120/121/122 are integrated
into this branch.
Their accepted evidence keeps its original cuts; integration adds no new execution
credit. The active table is a handoff snapshot, not a claim of current validation
for private changes.

## Remaining core work

- Finish the partial inventory obligations across every source constructor and
  runtime dependency. Unsupported cases remain explicit; a passing bounded slice
  does not close its family.
- Extend warning/read/cast and argument consumers, callable/Closure forms,
  reference parameters/returns and constrained coercions without erasing delayed
  reads, diagnostic priority, saved targets or abrupt cleanup.
- Complete wider array/object/reference ownership, nested access and key forms,
  ArrayAccess/Iterator interactions, COW, released targets and callback lifetimes.
- Complete remaining class/static/trait/enum/attribute/hook/readonly contexts and
  wider magic/property/callable producers, including reentry and typed aliases.
- Complete wider Generator/Fiber suspension, delegation, destructor reentry,
  physical collection, weak-reference/WeakMap, output/shutdown/tick and other
  required lifecycle behavior.
- Extend remaining Traversable CONFIG producers, consumers and lifetimes beyond
  initialized user Iterators and the bounded empty/singleton WeakMap slice.
- Extend dynamic compilation, startup/configuration profiles, environment and
  provider consumers within the agreed core/intrinsic boundary. Ordinary external
  libraries/services are separate; builtin presence alone supplies no semantics.
- Run final combined current-source validation and a fresh copied-path,
  network-isolated offline rebuild. Current local tool reuse is not that rebuild.

Interaction-tree semantics in Rocq and the selected BOLA/CRIS proofs follow
completed PHP core and renewed differential validation; they are not established
by these tests.

## Paused boundaries

Do not resume or broaden these lanes through neighboring work:

- OP12 increment/decrement dimension warnings.
- Source47 low-precision DEFINE-name NaN conversion.
- Owned-NUL source-release behavior.
- Undefined by-reference LIST key handling.
- COMP88 Stringable supplied-throw crash.

## Validation and evidence

Use the pinned project-local PHP oracle and matching profile. Preserve original
bytes/path/cwd, raw streams/status, semantic completion, tested revision,
compiler/runtime identity, commands and relevant environment. Ordinary, explicit
request and callable profiles retain separate contracts.

Independent review covers semantic correctness, counterexamples and test
reliability. Fix discrepancies narrowly; rerun affected checks only. Metadata
edits and pointwise disjoint composition do not renew accepted execution credit.
Interrupted, timed-out, Unsupported, malformed and budget-control outcomes remain
separate from native agreements. State fixtures complement source comparisons.

Large originals and raw failures stay outside Git; [ARTIFACTS](docs/ARTIFACTS.md)
provides recovery. Detailed prior checkpoints remain in their existing ledgers,
[MILESTONE-HISTORY](MILESTONE-HISTORY.md), and Git history through `25b63539e`.
The [post-arrow baseline](coverage/semantics/post-arrow-integration-review.json)
retains its historical profile/count identities, not current full-core coverage.
Keep this file focused on current behavior, remaining work and active boundaries;
replace superseded status prose instead of accumulating receipt history.
